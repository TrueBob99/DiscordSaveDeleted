You can delete every message from memory by clicking [X] button.
To record several channels, just open a new browser tab with needed channel and make sure this script is working.
You can switch between channels and every channel will show its deleted messages storage.
Make sure you enabled auto-update in your userscript settings, so you can get later versions.
